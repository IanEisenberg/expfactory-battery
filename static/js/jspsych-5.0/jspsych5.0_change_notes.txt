- The main change is that the "experiment_structure" argument within the jspsych.init function that runs the experiment is now called a "timeline"
--> Implied change: wherever jspsych.init function is called all "experiment_structure"s should be replaced with "timeline" referring to the same experiment array that contains the blocks

- In jspsych-text plugin the "cont_key" parameter now only accepts arrays for numeric key codes
--> Implied change: convert any "cont_key = 13" to "cont_key = [13]"

- jspsych-instructions plugin no longer has the "timing_post_trial" parameter
--> Implied change: remove the "timing_post_trial" parameter wherever it was used within the jspsych-instructions plugin

- jspsych-single-stim plugin "stimuli" parameter has been changed to "stimulus" and the type is no longer and array but a string.
--> Implied change: change "stimuli" parameter to read "stimulus" and remove the square brackets to leave only strings as inputs.

- Multiple stimuli within the jspsych-single-stim plugin must now be specified by the "timeline" parameter instead of the "stimuli" parameter. 
--> Implied change: within the jspsych-single-stim plugin the "stimuli" parameter should be replaced by a "timeline" that consists of that consists of an array with "stimulus" and, if desired, additional parameters specified within objects, as well. The added functionality can be used for many of the hacks that we had been using in creating random lists, conditional loops etc.
